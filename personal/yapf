# four styles are predefined:
- pep8 (default)
- google (based off of the Google Python Style Guide)
- yapf (for use with Google open source projects)
- facebook

# YAPF will search for the formatting style in the following manner:
1.Specified on the command line
    eg: --style='{based_on_style: pep8, indent_width: 2}'
2.In the [style] section of a `.style.yapf` file in either the current directory or one of its parent directories.
    eg: [style]
        based_on_style = yapf
        spaces_before_comment = 4
        split_before_logical_operator = true
3.In the [yapf] section of a `setup.cfg` file in either the current directory or one of its parent directories.
    eg: [yapf]
        based_on_style = pep8
        blank_line_before_nested_class_or_def = true
        split_before_expression_after_opening_paren = true
4.In the [tool.yapf] section of a `pyproject.toml` file in either the current directory or one of its parent directories.
    eg: [tool.yapf]
        based_on_style = pep8
        blank_line_before_nested_class_or_def = true
        split_before_expression_after_opening_paren = true
5.In the [style] section of a `~/.config/yapf/style` file in your home directory.
6.If none of those files are found, the default style is used (PEP8).
